# REST API for my Portfolio

## What is this?

This is a REST API with CRUD-functionality that I use to update my portfolio. You can find my portfolio here: http://charlotteranemo.se/

All of my uploaded work, workplaces and education goes through this API, which is handled by me using my admin-page that you can find here: http://charlotteranemo.se/pAdmin/

## How does it work?

I have built this using PHP. I have divided it into classes (Work, Websites, Courses as well as Database that I have decided to gitignore when uploading due to security reasons).

I then have three files, one for each category, that I have put a databaseconnection as well as a switch to see which of the request methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) that the request includes.
